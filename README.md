# KubernetesCryptoAutomationPlatform

## Description

A Rust-based cryptographic library providing hardware-accelerated elliptic curve operations over prime fields optimized for zero-knowledge proofs, leveraging SIMD intrinsics and targeting WASM compilation for enhanced cross-platform performance.

## Features

- Automates certificate rotation across Kubernetes clusters using Let's Encrypt integration.
- Encrypts sensitive data at rest in etcd using AES-256 encryption with customizable key management.
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC) for cryptographic key management within the platform.
- Integrates with HashiCorp Vault for secure storage and retrieval of secrets and cryptographic keys.
- Supports automated generation and distribution of TLS certificates for Kubernetes services.
- Validates the integrity of container images using cryptographic signatures before deployment.
- Enforces cryptographic policies for data in transit using mutual TLS (mTLS) between microservices.
- Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing cryptographic resources and configurations.
## Installation

```bash
pip install kubernetescryptoautomationplatform
```
